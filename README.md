## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to understand and analyze the growth patterns and trends in the number of users for ChatGPT. By leveraging the power of Power BI, I aim to provide clear and concise visualizations that help in gaining insights into user growth over time.

## Data Collection

The data for this analysis was collected by scraping the website [https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users). The website provides information and statistics about the growth of ChatGPT users. The data collected includes various attributes such as dates, user counts, and additional relevant information.

## Data Cleaning

To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the collected data, a thorough data cleaning process was undertaken. This involved removing any irrelevant or duplicate records, handling missing values, and standardizing the data format. The cleaned data formed the basis for subsequent analysis and visualization.

## Analysis

The analysis of the growth of ChatGPT users was conducted using Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool. The cleaned data was imported into Power BI, where various visualizations and reports were created to explore the growth patterns and trends.

The analysis primarily focused on the following aspects:

1. **Days ChatGPT took to reach 1 Million users:** This visualization presents the timeline depicting the duration it took for ChatGPT to achieve the milestone of one million users. The chart compares this achievement with prominent online services including Instagram, Dropbox, Spotify, Facebook, Foursquare, Twitter, Airbnb, Kickstarter, and Netflix, highlighting the number of days each service required to reach the one million user mark. Notably, ChatGPT accomplished this feat in a remarkably short period of just five days, securing the leading position. Instagram emerged as the second-fastest service, while Netflix exhibited the longest duration, taking approximately 1,278 days to reach the coveted one million user milestone.
