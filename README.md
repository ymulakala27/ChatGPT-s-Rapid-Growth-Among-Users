# ChatGPT's Rapid Growth Among Users Project

This project focuses on analyzing the growth of users on ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, using Power BI. The data for this analysis was obtained by scraping the relevant information from the website [https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users). The collected data was then cleaned and visualized to derive meaningful insights.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to understand and analyze the growth patterns and trends in the number of users for ChatGPT. By leveraging the power of Power BI, I aim to provide clear and concise visualizations that help in gaining insights into user growth over time.

## Data Collection

The data for this analysis was collected by scraping the website [https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users). The website provides information and statistics about the growth of ChatGPT users. The data collected includes various attributes such as dates, user counts, and additional relevant information.

## Data Cleaning

To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the collected data, a thorough data cleaning process was undertaken. This involved removing any irrelevant or duplicate records, handling missing values, and standardizing the data format. The cleaned data formed the basis for subsequent analysis and visualization.

## Analysis

The analysis of the growth of ChatGPT users was conducted using Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool. The cleaned data was imported into Power BI, where various visualizations and reports were created to explore the growth patterns and trends.

The analysis primarily focused on the following aspects:

1. **Days ChatGPT took to reach 1 Million users:** This Visualization was created to showcase the overall time it took ChatGPT to reach 1 Million users mark. This includes bar chart to illustrate a comparision of online services such as Instagram, DropBox, Spotify, Facebook, Foursquare, Twitter, AirBnb, Kickstarter and Netflix, with ChatGPT on the number of days each of this service took to reach 1 Million user mark. ChatGPT just took 5 days to reach this mark, Instagram was in the second place and Netflix was in the last place taking about 1,278 days to reach the 1 Million mark.

2. **User Growth by Time Period:** The data was segmented into specific time periods, since it's launch in months, to analyze the growth patterns within those intervals. Line Chart visualization was used to highlight the user growth trends across different time periods. I also forecsted the growth from April 2023 to July 2023.
